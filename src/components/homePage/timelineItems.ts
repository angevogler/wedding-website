        content: "During our first trip to Asheville together we visited the Biltmore Estate, countless breweries, and did a few hikes along the Blue Ridge Parkway. We enjoyed this trip so much that we've tried to turn it into something that we do every year. It's because of this tradition that we decided to have our wedding In Asheville so that we could share our love for the city with our family and friends",

        content: "We got engaged! David planned a full afternoon of visiting most of our favorite spots in Charlotte. After rain changed our schedule, we took Tucker with us to Birdsong, where we shared our first date, and Freedom Park, where we've fished together in the pond and shared many walks during lockdown. Then, much to Angela's surprise, we headed back home where David snuck a handwritten bandana onto Tucker asking Angela to go outside where he was waiting to ask her to marry him. An even bigger surprise was the fact that our friends Olivia and Grey had captured the moment and Angela's family and a lot of our local Charlotte friends came over for a surprise engagement party"
